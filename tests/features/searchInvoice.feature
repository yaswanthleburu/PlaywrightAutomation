#     Given I am logged into the CMS application
#     When I navigate to the Invoices section from Billing menu
#     And I search for invoice number "SAC30000841C"
#     Then I should see the invoice listed in the search result
#     When I select the invoice and choose to download it
#     And I confirm the invoice download
